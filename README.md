## Features
- Fast-paced asteroid 2D shooter
- Increasing difficulty with time
- Score tracking and health system

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Freeshea/AsteroidRush.git`
2. Open the project in Godot Engine (I used Godot_v4.2.2)
3. Run the game from the Godot editor

## Usage
- Use the mouse to aim and left click to shoot
- Press ESC to pause the game
- Destroy asteroids to earn points
- Pick up incoming health upgrades to stay in battle longer
- Avoid letting asteroids reach the left side of the screen, as this will cause them to crash into you and you will lose HP
